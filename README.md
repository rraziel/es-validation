# es-validation

A set of validation decorators inspired by [JSR-303](http://beanvalidation.org/1.0/), [JSR-349](http://beanvalidation.org/1.1/) and [JSR-380](http://beanvalidation.org/2.0/).

The library makes it possible to:

- define constraints on fields
- define constraints on parameters
- define constraints on returned values
- validate those constraints at runtime

## Installation

The module can be installed through npm:

```
npm install es-validation --save
```

## Development

The module can be built using the following command:

```
npm run build
```

It is also possible to keep unit tests executing as a background task:

```
npm run test
```
